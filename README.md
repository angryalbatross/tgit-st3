TortoiseGit Plugin for Sublime Text 3

A simple plugin to expose the best of the TortoiseGit GUI to the 
Sublime Text 3 context menu.

Adds the following to the context menu for an active file:

* Diff
* Show log
* Commit
* Sync

If there is no active file, it tries to guess the "relevant" repository
by looking at the project file or the first open folder.

Thanks to the authors and contributors of the following repositories, 
from whom I got useful direction:

* https://github.com/fyneworks/sublime-TortoiseGIT
* https://github.com/kemayo/sublime-text-git
